	abstract = {Abstract. Reservoir properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, surface tension, viscosity, fluid saturation, wettability, reservoir thickness, pressure, and temperature) are the function of time. Time variation of rock-fluid properties in a reservoir can be defined as memory concept in the field of petroleum engineering. Introducing memory formalism in reservoir simulation allows to account the time-varying nature of rock-fluid properties and enables reservoir simulator to provide more accurate reservoir flow forecast. The key purpose of this paper is to summarize the details for developing a memory formalism-based reservoir simulator. Within the context of the study, the key concept of memory formalism and fractional calculus are precisely explained. A complete roadmap in preparing a memory formalism-based reservoir simulator is shown with example and application.},
